#CYBER SECURITY TASK 6: PASSWORD STRENGTH EVALUATION REPORT

Objective:
To evaluate the strength of various passwords using an online tool and understand how password complexity improves security.

Tested Passwords:
1. franklin       → Score: 9%     → Complexity: Very Weak
2. franklin123    → Score: 44%    → Complexity: Good
3. fr@hklin_12    → Score: 65%    → Complexity: Strong
4. Franklin@123   → Score: 94%    → Complexity: Very Strong
5. Franklin@321#  → Score: 100%   → Complexity: Very Strong

Observations:
- Passwords with only lowercase letters scored the lowest.
- Including numbers slightly improved strength.
- Adding symbols, uppercase letters, and positioning them strategically greatly increased complexity and score.
- The password “Franklin@321#” had the highest score due to a strong mix of characters, length, and use of symbols/numbers.

Learnings:
- A strong password must include at least 3 of these: uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers.
- Length alone is not enough — character variety plays a crucial role.
- Avoid dictionary words, repeated characters, and predictable patterns.

Concepts Summary:
• Brute Force Attack: Tries all combinations of characters to guess a password.
• Dictionary Attack: Uses common words and variations to crack passwords.
• MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Adds an extra verification step for more security.
• Password Managers: Help generate and store complex passwords securely.
• Passphrases: A series of words or sentence-like passwords, e.g., “Coffee@Morning2025IsBest!” — easier to remember, harder to crack.

Best Practices:
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix of upper/lowercase, symbols, and numbers
- Avoid names, DOBs, or common words
- Change passwords regularly
- Enable MFA wherever possible

Conclusion:
As password complexity increased, so did the score and security rating. Using symbols, numbers, and longer combinations made passwords significantly stronger.
